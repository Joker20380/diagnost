            informed decisions.

            AI-Diagnostics was founded in Ghent, Belgium, by professionals with hands-on
            experience at the very bottom of the automotive service chain — where uncertainty,
            misdiagnosis, and lack of transparency are most visible.

            Years of practical work in vehicle diagnostics revealed a systemic problem:
            modern cars generate vast amounts of data, yet many service decisions are still
            made without structured analysis or clear reasoning.
          {% endblocktrans %}

          {% blocktrans %}
            The company was built to change this paradigm. Instead of selling “diagnostics”
            as a procedure, we focus on reducing uncertainty — for technicians, service
            managers, and vehicle owners alike.

            Based in Ghent, at the heart of Europe’s technological and automotive ecosystem,
            AI-Diagnostics combines real diagnostic experience with software engineering,
            artificial intelligence, and strict European standards for quality, safety,
            and accountability.

          {% blocktrans %}
            • Intelligent fault interpretation.<br>
            • Risk-aware diagnostic decision support.<br>
            • High-quality diagnostic documentation.<br>
            • Responsible use of AI in technical systems.

          {% blocktrans %}
            The core principle remains unchanged: respect for engineering, respect for data,
            and respect for every vehicle and client.
